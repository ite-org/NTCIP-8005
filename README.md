## Project Summary

NTCIP 8005 defines processes to verify the correctness of a Management Information Base (MIB) module contained in NTCIP data dictionary standards and to prepare a stand-alone version of the MIB  module. These processes are used by the NTCIP Joint Committee, its Working Groups (WGs), and NTCIP Data Stewards.
