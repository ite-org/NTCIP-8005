# General \[Informative\]

## Scope

This document specifies a set of rules for organizing, describing, and
defining transportation management information to be exchanged between
transportation management applications and transportation equipment.
This document defines the Structure and Identification of Management
Information (SMI) used in transportation-related devices. This document
is applicable to the NTCIP 1200 series and other NTCIP standards that
deal with device data dictionaries.

NOTE---This document relies on widely accepted conventions, generally
designated as "SMIv2" and defined in the Internet Architecture Board
(IAB) Standard (STD) 58.

## References

The following documents are referenced by this document. At the time of
publication, the editions indicated were valid.

### Normative References

Normative references contain provisions that, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of this document. All standards are subject

+======================+===============================================+
| **agent**            | The entity that receives requests and         |
|                      | transmits responses to the received requests. |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| **block object       | An object type that represents a standardized |

+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| **compatibility**    | The ability of two or more systems or         |
|                      | components to exchange information.           |

| **configurable       | An object type that represents a data         |
| object**             | structure that can be configured at run-time  |
|                      | to include elemental object types.            |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| **context**          | An instance of a management information base  |
|                      | (MIB).                                        |

|                      | NOTE---A single SNMP agent (e.g., a unique    |
|                      | UDP/IP address) typically represents a single |
|                      | context, but might support multiple contexts  |
|                      | if it, for example, serves as the interface   |
|                      | for multiple field devices (e.g., two dynamic |
|                      | message signs controlled by a single          |
|                      | controller) or serves as a proxy agent for    |
|                      | multiple field devices. When there are        |
|                      | multiple contexts, there might be multiple    |
|                      | object instances with the same object         |
|                      | identifier and the context is used to         |
|                      | disambiguate.                                 |

|                      | stamped) as determined by the Controller.     |

|                      | "object" to describe this concept to prevent  |
|                      | any ambiguity with an object referenced by    |
|                      | the international object identifier tree or   |
|                      | an object type.                               |

|                      | a device (zero or many times depending on how |
|                      | it is specified). It specifies the data using |

| **Simple Network     | A communications protocol developed by the    |
| Management Protocol  | Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), used  |
| (SNMP)**             | for configuration and monitoring of network   |
