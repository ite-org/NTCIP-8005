*[agent]: entity that receives requests and transmits responses to the received requests.
*[block object type]: An object type that represents a standardized data structure of elemental object types.
*[compatibility]: ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information \[ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765\]
*[configurable object]: An object type that represents a data structure that can be configured at run-time to include elemental object types.
*[context]: instance of a management information base(MIB). NOTE---A single SNMP agent (e.g., a unique UDP/IP address) typically represents a single context, but can support multiple contexts.
*[datagram]: self-contained unit of data transmitted independently of other datagrams.
*[deprecated]: indicates the user need, requirement, dialog, or object is valid in limited circumstances, but has been replaced by another.
*[file]: grouping of data into a single sequence of bytes that can be referred to by file operations.
*[intelligent transportation systems (ITS)]: application of advanced information  processing and communications, sensing, and control technologies to surface transportation with the objective of promoting more efficient use of the existing highway and transportation network, increasing safety and mobility, and decreasing environmental impacts.
*[interchangeable]: condition which exists when two or more items possess such functional and physical characteristics as to be equivalent in performance and durability, and are capable of being exchanged one for the other without alteration of the items themselves, or adjoining items, except for adjustment, and without selection for fit and performance.
*[interoperability]: degree to which two or more systems, products  or components can exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged.
*[leaf object type]: object type that does not have any sub-identifiers assigned (other than for object instances)
*[management information base (MIB)]: structured collection of managed information contained within a SNMP context.  
*[Management Station]: computer system with which the device communicates. 
*[MIB module]: sequence of NVT ASCII characters conforming to X.208 Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) and IAB STD 58. MIB modules are used to define the data objects that are to make up the instantiated objects of the MIB. NOTE---A MIB module can be, and within NTCIP   typically is, presented as both part of a standard and as a stand-alone, computer-readable text file.
*[notification]: unsolicited event message issued by an SNMP agent for a management station
*[object]: entity identified by a node on the international object identifier tree.   NOTE -- See object instance and object type,   both of which are types of objects, along with any other entity that can be identified,  such as a standard. This document attempts to  use the most precise term within its text to assist in distinguishing among \"object type\" or \"object instance\". The use of the  term \"object\" is typically limited to registering items on the international object  identifier tree.
*[OBJECT IDENTIFIER]: unique name (identifier) that is associated with each type of object in a MIB that is a defined ASN.1 type.
*[object instance]: instance of an object type, which is an actual instance of data. NOTE --Â This document avoids using the term "object" to describe this concept to prevent any ambiguity with an object referenced by the international object identifier tree or an object type.
*[object type]: abstract specification for a specific piece of data that can be instantiated within  a device (zero or many times depending on how  it is specified). It specifies the data using  the OBJECT-TYPE macro.
*[OBJECT-TYPE]: X.208 ASN.1 macro used to define the meta-attributes of an object type in an SNMP MIB module.
*[obsolete]: status value that indicates the definition is no longer valid, was found to be flawed, was redundant, or was not useful.
*[protocol]: specific set of rules, procedures, and conventions defining the format and timing of  data transmissions between devices that are accepted and used to understand each other.
*[requirement]: a condition or capability to which a system shall conform
*[Requirements Traceability]: ability to follow or study the logical progression among the needs, requirements, and design details in a step-by-step fashion.
*[Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)]: communications protocol developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), used for configuration and monitoring of network devices.
*[trap]: unsolicited event message issued by an SNMP agent for a management station without any expectation of an acknowledgement.
*[user]: person using the system that is developed.
*[user need]: business or operational problem (opportunity) that is to be fulfilled to justify procurement or use.
*[ASCII]: American National Standard Code for Information Interchange
*[ASN.1]: Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined by either ITU-T X.208 or ITU-T X.680 (ISO/IEC 8824-1) (within the context used, both apply)
*[BER]: Basic Encoding Rules, as defined by ITU-T X.690 (ISO/IEC 8825-1)
*[IAB STD]: Internet Architecture Board Standard
*[IANA]: Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
*[IEC]: International Electrotechnical Commission
*[IEEE]: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
*[IETF]: Internet Engineering Task Force
*[IP]: Internet Protocol
*[ITU-T]: International Telecommunication Union -- Telecommunication Standardization Sector
*[MVI]: Multi-Version Interoperability (formerly Backward Compatibility)
*[NVT]: Network Virtual Terminal
*[OER]: Octet Encoding Rules, as defined by ITU-T X.696 (ISO/IEC 8825-7)
*[OSI]: Open Systems Interconnection
*[PDU]: Protocol Data Unit
*[PRL]: Protocol Requirements List
*[RFC]: Request for Comments
*[SMI]: Structure and Identification of Management Information
*[SNMP]: Simple Network Management Protocol version 3
*[TCP]: Transport Control Protocol
*[UML]: Unified Modeling Language
*[X.208 ASN.1]: Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined by ITU-T X.208
*[X.680 ASN.1]: Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined by ITU-T X.680 (ISO/IEC 8824-1)
