# Development Process {.body}

## Process Flow {.body}

There are actions defined for NTCIP MIB module creation and maintenance at specific stages of the NTCIP standards development process as defined in NTCIP 8001 v02. The following stages of the NTCIP development process trigger actions of the Data Steward.

1. WG Prepares Proposed User Comment Draft (pUCD) Standard
2. WG Prepares Proposed Recommended Standard (pRS)
3. NTCIP SDOs Approve Standard
4. Amended or Revised
5. Rescinded

### WG Prepares Proposed User Comment Draft (pUCD) Standard {.body}

NTCIP WG submits proposed User Comment Draft (pUCD) standard to the NTCIP Joint Committee for review and acceptance as a UCD. Prior to this submission, a pUCD that contains a MIB module is to have the syntax checked as defined in NTCIP 8005 Section 3 as follows:

1. The NTCIP WG makes the MIB file (computer readable MIB module) available to the assigned Data Steward.
2. The Data Steward checks the syntax of the MIB in the context of all other NTCIP MIB files.
3. The Data Steward reviews the MIB file as to possible duplication of Object Definitions within other NTCIP standards.
4. The Data Steward submits a User Comment to the NTCIP Coordinator and WG chair and/or document editor, reporting on the Data Steward’s compilation/review of the MIB file.
5. The User Comment is logged and filed, and any MIB file revisions to be made during the disposition of User Comments and subsequent revisions to the pUCD standard are identified.
6. When revisions are complete, the Data Steward posts a UCD version of the MIB file at the NTCIP MIB FTP site hosted by NEMA.

### NTCIP SDOs Approve Standard {.body}

NTCIP WGs submit proposed Recommended Standards (pRS) to the NTCIP Joint Committee for review and acceptance as a Recommended Standard. Prior to this submission, a pRS that contains a MIB module is to have the syntax checked as defined in NTCIP 8005 Section 3 as follows:

1. The NTCIP WG makes the MIB file available to the assigned Data Steward.
2. The Data Steward checks the syntax of the MIB in the context of all other NTCIP MIB files.
3. The Data Steward reviews the MIB file as to possible duplication of Object Definitions within other NTCIP standards.
4. The Data Steward submits a WG comment to the NTCIP Coordinator and WG chair and/or document editor, reporting on the Data Steward’s compilation/review of the MIB file.
5. The Data Steward WG comment and any MIB file revisions to be made during the disposition of WG comments and subsequent revisions to the pRS standard are identified.
6. When revisions are complete, the Data Steward posts a Recommended Standard version of the MIB file at the NTCIP MIB FTP site hosted by NEMA and deletes the UCD version.
7. The Data Steward provides a summary of the syntax check and it is included in the ITE Standards Development Report.

### Jointly Approved {.body}

Upon approval by all three NTCIP SDOs (AASHTO, ITE, and NEMA), a Data Steward updates the MIB file to indicate the Jointly Approved status of the NTCIP standard. The Data Steward posts the updated MIB file (mibFileName.mib) at the NTCIP MIB FTP site. The Data Steward does not remove the Recommended Standard version of the MIB file.

### Amended or Revised {.body}

When an NTCIP standard is amended or revised to a higher major version number, the same procedures as those used for User Comment Drafts and Recommended Standards are used.

### Rescinded {.body}

If an NTCIP standard containing a MIB module is rescinded, the Data Steward “retires” the applicable MIB file. “Retiring” consists of adding a "Rescinded" label to the affected MIB file and removing the name of the MIB file from the checking lists. The Data Steward revises the MIB file but does not remove the MIB file from the NTCIP MIB NEMA FTP site.

## Intellectual Property Rights {.body}

The intellectual property rights of AASHTO, ITE, and/or NEMA, regarding the NTCIP standards publications, and the included works known as the MIB modules and MIB files, are claimed in the front matter notices of the standards publications, and in the header of the MIB files. AASHTO, ITE, and NEMA also extend certain MIB module and MIB file distribution permission. All MIB module and MIB file users are required to follow the instructions in the MIB Distribution Permission notice found under “Notices” in those NTCIP standards that contain a MIB module. This includes the derivation citation.
