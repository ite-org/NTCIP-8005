When there are multiple contexts, there might be multiple object instances with the same object identifier and the context is used to disambiguate. current Reflecting the conditions at the present time (or at the time at which the data is time stamped) as determined by the Controller. Within the context of a status value, indicates the most up-to-date design of the element (e.g., user need, requirement, object). data Information before it is interpreted. datagram A self-contained unit of data transmitted independently of other datagrams. deprecated A status value that indicates the user need, requirement, dialog, or object is valid in limited circumstances, but has been replaced by another.NOTE\u2014This definition is modified from \u201cUnderstanding SNMP MIBS.\u201d Procurements can require support for deprecated objects to anable multi-version interoperability (e.g., backward compatibility) with legacy implementations. file A grouping of data into a single sequence of bytes that can be referred to by file operations.NOTE\u2014A file exists nominally in a directory, and can have an associated path. intelligent transportation systems (ITS) The application of advanced information processing and communications, sensing, and control technologies to surface transportation with the objective of promoting more efficient use of the existing highway and transportation network, increasing safety and mobility, and decreasing environmental impacts.NOTE\u2014Also known as \"intelligent transport systems\" International Organization for Standardization (ISO) An international standards organization.NOTE\u2014ANSI is the primary interface to ISO within the United States. Often thought to be International Standards Organization, because of its acronym ISO. internet A large collection of connected networks, primarily in the United States, running the Internet suite of protocols.NOTE\u2014Sometimes referred to as the DARPA Internet, NSF/DARPA Internet, or the Federal Research Internet. Interchangeable A condition which exists when two or more items possess such functional and physical characteristics as to be equivalent in performance and durability, and are capable of being exchanged one for the other without alteration of the items themselves, or adjoining items, except for adjustment, and without selection for fit and performance.Note: See National Telecommunications and Information Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce interoperability Degree to which two or more systems, products or components can exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged.[ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765] leaf object type An object type that does not have any sub-identifiers assigned (other than for object instances) management information base (MIB) A structured collection of managed information contained within a SNMP context. A MIB represents the instantiated data objects defined by one or more MIB modules and integrated into a device or management station. Management Station The computer system with which the device communicates. Typically, the management station commands and monitors the device. MIB module A sequence of NVT ASCII characters conforming to X.208 Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) and IAB STD 58. MIB modules are used to define the data objects that are to make up the instantiated objects of the MIB.NOTE\u2014A MIB module can be, and within NTCIP typically is, presented as both part of a standard and as a stand-alone, computer-readable text file. National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol (NTCIP) A family of protocols that provide common control and data collection services as well as accommodating various system topologies and data routing duties.NOTE\u2014NTCIP is designed to support not only currently deployed systems, but also new systems and technologies as they become available. network A collection of devices connected by intermediate systems and populated by end systems. notification An unsolicited event message issued by an SNMP agent for a management station with an expectation of an acknowledgement. object An entity identified by a node on the international object identifier tree.NOTE \u2013 See object instance and object type, both of which are types of objects, along with any other entity that can be identified, such as a standard. This document attempts to use the most precise term within its text to assist in distinguishing among \"object type\" or \"object instance\". The use of the term \"object\" is typically limited to registering items on the international object identifier tree. OBJECT IDENTIFIER A unique name (identifier) that is associated with each type of object in a MIB that is a defined ASN.1 type. object instance An instance of an object type, which is an actual instance of data.NOTE \u2013 This document avoids using the term \u201cobject\u201d to describe this concept to prevent any ambiguity with an object referenced by the international object identifier tree or an object type. object type An abstract specification for a specific piece of data that can be instantiated within a device (zero or many times depending on how it is specified). It specifies the data using the OBJECT-TYPE macro. OBJECT-TYPE An X.208 ASN.1 macro used to define the meta-attributes of an object type in an SNMP MIB module. obsolete A status value that indicates the definition is no longer valid, was found to be flawed, was redundant, or was not useful.NOTE\u2014In the next (or some future) edition of a standard, any element (e.g., requirement, object) with a status of \u201cobsolete\u201d can be removed. This definition is modified from \u201cUnderstanding SNMP MIBS.\u201d protocol A specific set of rules, procedures, and conventions defining the format and timing of data transmissions between devices that are accepted and used to understand each other. Requirement A requirement describes a condition or capability to which a system shall conform; either derived directly from user needs, or stated in a contract, standard, specification, or other normative document. A desired feature, property, or behavior of a system. Requirements Traceability The ability to follow or study the logical progression among the needs, requirements, and design details in a step-by-step fashion. Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) A communications protocol developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), used for configuration and monitoring of network devices. Trap An unsolicited event message issued by an SNMP agent for a management station without any expectation of an acknowledgement. User A person using the system that is developed. User Need The business or operational problem (opportunity) that is to be fulfilled to justify procurement or use.Note: While this is termed a \u201cuser need\u201d within the NTCIP community, it reflects needs of all stakeholders."},{"location":"general/#abbreviations","title":"Abbreviations","text":"<p>The abbreviations and acronyms used in this document are defined as follows:</p> ASCII American National Standard Code for Information Interchange ASN.1 Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined by either ITU-T X.208 or ITU-T X.680 (ISO/IEC 8824-1) (within the context used, both apply) BER Basic Encoding Rules, as defined by ITU-T X.690 (ISO/IEC 8825-1) IAB STD Internet Architecture Board Standard IANA Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IEC International Electrotechnical Commission IEEE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IETF Internet Engineering Task Force IP Internet Protocol ITU-T International Telecommunication Union \u2013 Telecommunication Standardization Sector MVI Multi-Version Interoperability (formerly Backward Compatibility) NVT Network Virtual Terminal OER Octet Encoding Rules, as defined by ITU-T X.696 (ISO/IEC 8825-7) OSI Open Systems Interconnection PDU Protocol Data Unit PRL Protocol Requirements List RFC Request for Comments SMI Structure and Identification of Management Information SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 TCP Transport Control Protocol UML Unified Modeling Language X.208 ASN.1 Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined by ITU-T X.208 X.680 ASN.1 Abstract Syntax Notation One, as defined by ITU-T X.680 (ISO/IEC 8824-1)"},{"location":"introduction/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This document specifies a set of rules for organizing, describing, and defining transportation management information to be exchanged between transportation management applications and transportation equipment.
